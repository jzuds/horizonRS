# About the Grande Exchange (GE)
The Grand Exchange is a centralized, anonymous marketplace where buy and sell offers are matched by price and time priority, with prices shaped by real player supply and demand rather than a visible order book. For money-making, success comes from exploiting short-term inefficiencies in spread, volume, and fill speed while accounting for tax, liquidity, and execution risk.

## Opportunty Types
- **Spread Capture** | [About](about-spread-capture.md) | [Example](example-spread-capture.md)

## How do we define a flipping opportuntity?

> A flip is valid if it can be entered, exited quickly, and produces consistent profit after tax with acceptable fill probability.

$$
Expected Value = (Sell - Buy - Tax) \times FillRate > 0
